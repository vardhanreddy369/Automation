# Ralph Loop - Continuous Autonomous Development

Inspired by Geoffrey Huntley's continuous development loop, this workflow sets me up for persistent, autonomous work.

**Steps for the Agent:**
1. **Initialize State Trackers:** I will immediately locate and read `PRD.md` (Product Requirements Document) and `progress.md` state trackers in your directory to understand the full project context and current state.
2. **Execute Current Task:** I will identify the **very next uncompleted task**, implement the code for it, and strictly verify it with automated tests or linters without asking for permission.
3. **Commit & Transition:** I will log the work done, update the `progress.md` file to reflect completion, and explicitly ask you if I should immediately jump to the next uncompleted task in the loop, or wait for your feedback.
